<h2 class="content-subhead">Programming Overview</h2>
<p>

  The software that the AUV runs is spread out across several microcontrollers. The programs on

Arduino Uno microcontrollers that are connected to sensors continuously receive input from the

sensors and output this data to the Raspberry Pis. The Arduino Uno that is connected to the

thrusters does the reverse – it receives data from the Raspberry Pis that tell it which thrusters to

turn on or off. The programs on the Raspberry Pis are more complicated. One of the Raspberry

Pis is connected to two cameras. This Raspberry Pi takes the video from the camera and runs it

through an open-source image processing library called OpenCV. Any information determined

by this image processing is then sent to the other Raspberry Pi. The second Raspberry Pi collects

all of the data from all of the other microcontrollers and stores the data in a file. It then takes the

data and analyzes it to determine which task it should be performing and how to change the

thruster speeds in order to complete this task. One essential part of the design is the use of multiple microcontrollers, including two Raspberry

Pi 2s and several Arduino Unos. These were chosen because they are relatively easy to use for

people who have little previous experience programming microcontrollers. The Raspberry Pis

were specifically chosen because they have superior processing power, as well as a full Linux-

based operating system. This allows us to use image processing and other processor-intensive

algorithms to analyze sensor and camera data. The Arduino Unos, on the other hand, have very

little processing power, but can more easily handle serial input from the sensors and output to the

thrusters. The microcontrollers communicate using serial communication along a USB cable

between an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi and using TCP/IP along an Ethernet cable between

the two Raspberry Pis.

<div class="pure-u-4-5"> <h2 class="content-subhead">Image Processing</h2><p>The vision subsystem provides crucial information for target tracking and course navigation. Two

Logitech HD Webcam C270 cameras, one facing forward for course navigation and the other facing

downward for path marker identification, were placed on the frontal section of the vehicle. Software

module for image processing and computer vision was built utilizing Intel’s OpenCV 2.4 library.

In order to achieve real time target tracking based on color detection, first, the upper and lower

boundaries of the desired color in the HSV color space are predefined. The frame is resized to have a

width of 600px. Downsizing the frame allows to process the frame faster, leading to an increase in

FPS (due to less image data to process). The frame is then blurred to reduce high frequency noise and

allow to focus on the structural objects inside the frame. Finally, a conversion from the frame to the

HSV color space is done. On the other hand, to determine the distance from the vehicle to a known

object, triangle similarity index is utilized. By working collaboratively with the color detection module,

the AUV is able to identify objects based on color and estimate distance with respect to AUV’s location.

Necessary data analysis is executed in order to maneuver the vehicle to correct position.</p></div>
<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content-subhead">Thruster Control</h2><p>The thrusters are controlled through the combined operation of an Arduino Uno microcontroller and a Raspberry

Pi B. The Arduino Uno is connected to various sensors, which collect information about the surroundings and state

of the robot to the Arduino Uno. The Arduino Uno receives the data and transfers it to the Raspberry Pi for data

analysis. Serial communication exists between the Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi utilizes

programming language Python 2.7 to interpret the data received from the sensors through the Arduino. Based on

the data process, the program formulates a plan of action for the thrusters. These commands are then

transmitted from the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino Uno, which outputs the instructions to the thrusters. This is an

iterative process, so that the vehicle is able to constantly adjust to its surroundings.</p></div>
