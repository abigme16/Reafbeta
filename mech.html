<h2 class="content2-subhead">Exterior Design & Thrusters</h2>
<p><br>
 The structure of the AUV is a basic rectangular prism shape with a cylindrical
 electronics housing inside. The main structure is made of extruded T-slotted
 aluminum to allow fast and easy adjustments to the structure. The material being
 used is 6061 aluminum which has good corrosion resistance, a good strength to weight
 ratio, and is cost effective.  The AUV is propelled through water using  four
 BlueRobotics T200 thrusters, which can provide 7.8 lbf at 12V. The thrusters are
 placed to allow three degrees of freedom. The AUV is trimmed to a neutral buoyancy
 so that the thrusters will not have to run constantly to keep it at the needed depth.
 All external wiring are fed into the electronics enclosure using custom-made cable
 penetrators that allow the cables inside the housing without compromising the water
 -tight properties of the tube. Water-tight enclosures have been designed for the sensors
 that are not waterproof.<br>

<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content2-subhead">Battery Encasement</h2>
<p>The battery housing is composed by two parallel clear tubes and aluminum endcaps attached to the bottom of the AUV. The inner diameter of each the tube is 3.5 inches with a 1/8 wall thickness and a length of 7.5 inches. Because the battery housing is meant to be opened and closed to switch out batteries, the endcaps were fabricated using a lathing machine to allow easy access to inside the tube while ensuring that the seal to the caps would be watertight after closing it off. Aluminum 6061 was chosen as the material for the endcaps for its strength to weight ratio and its cost efficiency. By using the aluminum, less weight is added as well as less corrosion occurs when submerging the vehicle underwater. The static endcap, shown in Figure 1, is epoxied to the end of one side of the tube, which is meant to stay closed and provide water tightness. The removable endcaps had two components: a collar and lid. The collar of the removable endcap, shown in Figure 2, is epoxied to the inside of the tube and uses two O-rings to provide a watertight seal with a lip on the collar for bolting the lid and collar closed. For the lid, shown in Figure 3, sub con-connectors are utilized to allow the wires from the batteries to pass through outside of the tube and connect to the power distributor PCB in the housing unit for electronic components. The tubing uses polycarbonate material for its durability and being clear so its contents are able to be seen.

<h2 class="content2-subhead">Pressure Relief Valves</h2>
<div class="pure-u-4-5"><p>DeepSea Power & Light manufactures a product that has been considered for Ula, the submarine for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Competition. It is able to reach depths of 6,000 meters to 11,000 meters in depth, far more than the requirements of the submarine. The pressure relief valve has three different parts with diameters of 18.4 mm, 19.1 mm, and 14.3 mm. Furthermore, the lengths of the parts are, 23.1 mm, 24.8 mm, and 25 mm. The pressure relief valve can withstand a psi of 5 to 15, which will not be an issue with the environment the submarine will be put into. Also, the product comes with accessories such as, a vacuum fitting and tools for installment. The pressure relief valve is also easy to install and ideal for a first year AUV team. </p></div>

<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content2-subhead">Interior Design</h2>
<p>The design of the interior circuit racks were fabricated so that it part placement was not fixed and the tray was adaptable.There are two circuit racks within the hull and four frames. Both the frames and racks are composed of 0.22” acrylic. Acrylic material was chosen due to it’s cost and ability to be laser cut quickly. The main ideology behind the interior design was to have circuit trays with holes throughout the tray. The electrical components would then be attached by thin platforms with pegs corresponding to the size of each component. Then those platforms are crossed with platforms that correspond to the placement of the holes on the rack.With this design, each component would be allowed to be placed anywhere along the rack and can be easily moved.

<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content2-subhead">Sensor Water Proofing</h2>
<p>The team got two pressure sensors based off of consistency and accuracy. One for the inside of the tube and one to attach on the outside. Because two depth sensors that were ordered the AUV were not fully watertight.Our first attempt to solve this problem was to create a case housing for the depth sensor. The design was made on Solidworks and consisted of the case and the endcap. It would be sealed by using a face seal and an o-ring so that it would be watertight.After lots of time and effort to create and 3D print the casing for the pressure sensor, we realized that the 3D printing strategy would not be effective for the chances of holes in the case would create leaks and deterioration was highly likely. Because of time stress, our final solution for the depth sensor was to use a PVC pipe sealed with a marine epoxy to seal what was considered not to be water tight. This is not only cost effective but also less time consuming.
