<h2 class="content2-subhead">Exterior Design & Thrusters</h2>
<p><br>
 The structure of the AUV is a basic rectangular prism shape with a cylindrical
 electronics housing inside. The material being
 used is 6061 aluminum which has good corrosion resistance, a good strength to weight
 ratio, and is cost effective.  The AUV is propelled through water using  four
 BlueRobotics T200 thrusters, which can allow three degrees of freedom.
 All external wiring are fed into the electronics enclosure using custom-made cable
 penetrators that allow the cables inside the housing without compromising the water
 -tight properties of the tube. Water-tight enclosures have been designed for the sensors
 that are not waterproof.<br>

<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content2-subhead">Electronics Hull</h2><p>
  The main electronics housing is made from polycarbonate tubing. A clear tube allows for easy visual
    inspection of the main electronic components. We chose to use a polycarbonate tube because
    it is stronger than acrylic. The endcaps to enclose the tube were machined out of 6061 aluminum.
     We chose to use 6061 aluminum because of its strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance
      and cost.   One of the endcaps for the main tube is never going to be removed so we epoxied
      it directly to the tube Loctite marine epoxy. For the other end we had to fabricate a collar
       that would fit over the end of the tube. A plate, that we use to pass all cables through
        to the inside of the electronics hull, is then attached to the collar using ten bolts.

<h2 class="content2-subhead">Pressure Relief Valves</h2>
<div class="pure-u-4-5"><p>DeepSea Power & Light manufactures a product that has been considered for Ula,
   the submarine for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Competition. It is able to reach depths of
   6,000 meters to 11,000 meters in depth, far more than the requirements of the submarine.
     The product comes with accessories such as, a vacuum fitting and tools for installment.</p></div>

<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content2-subhead">Interior Structures Design</h2>
<p>The design of the interior circuit racks were fabricated so that it part
   placement was not fixed and the tray was adaptable.There are two circuit
   racks within the hull and four frames. Each tray has holes that correspond to platforms fitted to each component
    With this design, each component would be
     allowed to be placed anywhere along the rack and can be easily moved.

<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content2-subhead">Sensor Water Proofing</h2>
<p>The team got two pressure sensors based off of consistency and accuracy.
   The sensors required water proofing. The first attempt to solve this problem was to create a
     case housing for the depth sensor. After testing, it was
      realized that the 3D printing strategy would not be effective for the
      chances of holes in the case would create leaks and deterioration was
      highly likely. Because of time stress, our final solution for the depth
      sensor was to use a PVC pipe sealed with a marine epoxy to seal what was
       considered not to be water tight. This is not only cost effective but
       also less time consuming.

<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content2-subhead">Battery Encasement</h2>
<p>The battery housing is composed by two parallel clear
  tubes and aluminum endcaps attached to the bottom of the AUV.
  Because the battery housing
    is meant to be opened and closed to switch out batteries, the endcaps
     were fabricated using a lathing machine to allow easy access to inside
      the tube while ensuring that the seal to the caps would be watertight
       after closing it off. Aluminum 6061 was chosen as the material for
       the endcaps for its strength to weight ratio and its cost efficiency.
