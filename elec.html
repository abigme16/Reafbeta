<h2 class="content3-subhead">Electrical Subsystem Overview</h2>
<p>

 	The electrical system consists of power distribution, sensors, and data transfer. This system is comprised primarily of purchased parts with the exception of the custom power distribution Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and thruster data transfer PCB. The electrical system also features wire management that is achieved through the use of zip ties.

</p>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content3-subhead">Power Distribution</h2><p>The electrical system must provided power to the computer, sensors, and thrusters of the AUV. This process can be separated into 2 major parts: providing each component with a voltage within its range, and maintaining that voltage so it never drops out of the range of the component. Several parts are used to fulfill these requirements, including a custom made pcb.

Two lithium polymer batteries provide power for the AUV. They are combined in parallel and fed into an ATX power supply which will maintain voltage rails that will connect to a custom pcb which will distribute power to the other components.
</p></div>
<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content3-subhead">M4 ATX Power Supply</h2><p>The M4-ATX DC-DC from Minibox, which allows the user to monitor and set up parameters for voltages, is used as the power supply. The ATX is equipped with 3.3 V, 5 V, and 12 V pins. It receives potential from the two 14.8 V batteries, converts it, and connects to the power distribution board which divides the voltage depending on what the different sensors, thrusters, and microcontrollers require.
The ignition, which is between the battery positive and battery negative (ground) input connector, is used for the kill switch.
As for the DIP (dual in-line package) switches, the power supply is set to setting P1, which gives a 5-second off-delay and a 1 minute AutoLatch. </p>
</div><div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content3-subhead">Component Placement</h2><p>
  The electrical components were placed according to power and data distribution

as well as heat production. The bottom tray houses the power distribution boards including
 the Power Control Board (PCB) and the M4-ATX.  Most of the components are housed on the top

racks including two Raspberry Pis, three Arduino Unoâ€™s, the AHRS (Altitude Heading

Reference System), and the pressure sensor. The AHRS and pressure sensor were placed

at opposite edges of the tube to allow for an accurate readings for each without

interference from other components. To absorb some of the heat to allow for a better

functioning board, two heat sinks were placed on each board with thermal adhesive

tape.</p><div>

<div class="pure-u-4-5"><h2 class="content3-subhead">Kill Switch</h2><p>The kill switch was designed as a switch that is connected to the M4 ATX ignition port. When the kill switch is not activated the ATX operates with the ignition in the on position but when it is pressed it switches the ignition port is off and the thrusters will receive no power. Unless the switch is flipped again, the switch will send a signal to ATX that will not let it output the power until it is flipped off. </p>
